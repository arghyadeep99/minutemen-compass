# Environment Setup

Create a `.env` file in the `backend/` directory with the following content:

```
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
```

To get your OpenAI API key:
1. Visit https://platform.openai.com/api-keys
2. Sign in with your OpenAI account
3. Create a new API key
4. Copy the key and paste it in the `.env` file

**Important**: Never commit the `.env` file to version control. It's already in `.gitignore`.
